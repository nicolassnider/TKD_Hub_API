# Environment variable sample for TKD_Hub_API frontend (SPA)
# Copy this file to `.env` or set variables in your environment.
# For Vite apps you can also prefix keys with VITE_ if you want them exposed to the client.


# API backend host (used by tests if set). Default in code: http://localhost:5000
API_HOST=http://localhost:5000


# End-to-end test credentials used by test/smoke-header.js
# (set these only for local/e2e runs; do NOT commit real credentials)
E2E_EMAIL=you@example.com
E2E_PASSWORD=supersecretpassword


# Example client-side keys (uncomment and prefix with VITE_ if you need them in the browser)
# VITE_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
# VITE_SOME_OTHER_KEY=your_value


# Notes:
# - Keep secrets out of source control. Add `.env` to .gitignore if not already ignored.
# - If you expose values to client-side code with Vite, use the VITE_ prefix (e.g. VITE_API_HOST).
